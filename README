This is avg_q (pronounced "average queue"), a multichannel (EEG/MEG/other
time series) data processor originally developed for analyzing event-related
brain activity.  It features built-in methods for filtering, detection,
spectral analysis, Independent Component Analysis, SVD/PCA, convolution and
many generic data operations as well as support for reading and writing several
data formats. Metadata (sampling rates / frequency resolution, events / markers,
channel names) are consistently passed through the processing queue.
The documentation can be found in the Documentation/ subdirectory (LyX source)
or the Programs_handbook.pdf file.
