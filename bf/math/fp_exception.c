/* We mask out all floating-point interrupts.
 * This is the default on Linux but not with DJGPP.
 * If we'd like to take better notice on the math errors occurring,
 * we would enable the interrupts but poll the type of error...
 * And then, this handler would have to be set in accordance to how
 * severe an error is under the particular circumstances of the algorithm
 * just executing... Anyway, in avg_q it appears to be pretty 
 * counterproductive to let the program terminate with a signal message or
 * a stack backtrace in case of a math error...
