 * array_multiply.c function to scan the next vectors of two arrays and
 * return their scalar product; if the two array pointers are equal,
 * an error results because independent position counters are necessary
 * to track the progress of the operation. If the square of a certain data
 * set has to be calculated, simply copy the array struct pointing to it,
 * transpose the first, and call array_multiply with the two arrays.
 *
 *	M=nr_of_elements, N=nr_of_vectors
 * The three ways of multiplying two matrices are indicated by the variable
 * mult_level. If this is MULT_BLOWUP, the result of each single multiplication
 * is returned, resulting in M1*N1*M2*N2 single elements. If it is
 * MULT_SAMESIZE, then the results of whole vector products is returned,
 * resulting in N1*N2 elements. If it is MULT_CONTRACT, then only a single
 * value is returned, namely the sum of all vector products.
 *
 * A special contraction is MULT_VECTOR, which allows to treat the two incoming
 * arrays as two simple sequences of vectors. The resulting matrix will have
 * size 1xN2.
 *
 * The state of the resulting matrix is indicated by array2->message.
 *
 * NOTE: Since array_multiply always multiplies the input matrices' vectors
 * and matrix products AB with a[vector][element] are defined by
 * (ab)[i][j]=a[k][j]*b[i][k]=a'[j][k]*b[i][k] where A' is the transposed
 * matrix A, we see that A has to be transposed to get a normal matrix product.
 * Put the other way round: array_multiply computes A'B.
