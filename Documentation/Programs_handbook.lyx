\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach chosen to implement a data analysis tool was to write a single,
 user configurable main program (called 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
) instead of many single utilities that would have to exchange large amounts
 of data via files.
 The main idea, as it presented itself originally, is contained in the name:
 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 stands for `average-queue' which means that there is a processing queue
 applied sequentially to epochs of incoming data, and the processed epochs
 are averaged.
 The configurable processing queue consists of a sequence of `methods' (algorith
ms), each of which works on the result of the previous.
 Averaging was only the first data reduction method the program featured;
 today, some more are available.
 Data reduction can also be omitted if the aim is to show, extract or transform
 the input data and not to produce a single-epoch result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 is configured by means of a script text file containing the name of one
 method per line together with its options and arguments.
 After configuration, the methods are executed from top to bottom with an
 implicit loop over all epochs yielded by the first method.
 Comments may be placed anywhere after a hash (`#') sign, just as in Unix
 shell scripts.
 Empty lines are ignored.
 Method options must follow the method name, precede any required arguments
 and start with a hyphen (`-').

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It must be noted that the script syntax is not intended as a general programming
 language.
 It only serves the purpose of configuration.
 There is no equivalent to variables as in programming languages, conditional
 execution or explicit looping.
 Therefore, it is not possible to implement every analysis within an 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 script without intermediate data files and external programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, to perform the same analysis on multiple input files or triggers
 or with a number of different analysis settings, it is of great advantage
 to have a command interface or batch interpreter at hand providing variables
 and looping, like the Unix shells or the widely available interpreted languages
 
\shape italic
perl
\shape default
 or 
\shape italic
python
\shape default
.
 Since 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 can read the configuration script from its standard input stream, looping
 can be performed as in the following example script for the Unix shell
 
\shape italic
sh
\shape default
.

 An arbitrary number of `Reject_Methods', `Transform_\SpecialChar softhyphen

 Note that the method type `Transform_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Methods' is very broad; there are
 `Transform_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Methods' that display data or start external programs but do
 not actually modify the data.
 `Put_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Methods' may be used to write each epoch at any processing stage
 in any of the available data formats.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A `Collect_Method' that takes all processed data epochs and yields a single
 data set after the last input epoch has been processed.
 This method ends the `iterated queue', i.e.
 the processing queue that is applied to every single input epoch generated
 by the `Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Method'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An optional keyword `Post:' on a line by itself, followed by an arbitrary
 number of methods as in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enum2"

\end_inset

) above.
 These methods represent the `post–processing queue' which is applied to
 the single data set generated by the `Collect_Method'.
 It is usually desirable to either display the result or to write it to
 a file, since there is no `default' handling of the result and it will
 be lost when the script terminates.

Multiple Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Methods and branching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Since May 1996, part (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enum1"

\end_inset

) was extended to allow multiple `Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Method's, each on a line by
 itself.
 Of such a `pool' of `Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Method's, the next method is initialized
 and used to obtain more epochs as one method ceases to yield epochs.
 With this feature it is possible to treat multiple files like a single
 stream of data, for example if files have been split because of mass storage
 limitations.
 Another common application is to create grand-averages or to concatenate
 sub-averages from different files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some applications, one may wish to perform different types of preprocessing
 on data read from different files, or even compare the results of different
 processing on the same file, and yet see the result as one sequence of
 epochs.
 This is implemented by `branching', which means that a number of transform
 methods following a `Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Method' are executed only for epochs from
 this `Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Method'.
 Such methods are marked in the script by preceding them with a `>' sign.
 During execution, these methods are executed or skipped together with the
 preceding `Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Method', thus creating a `branch' that is executed
 only on epochs coming from a given `Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Method'.
 An example: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse

# First line of avg_q script
\begin_inset Newline newline

readasc file1.asc
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\end_inset

\end_inset

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Post:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

writeasc average.asc
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

# Last line of avg_q script
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
This script resamples all epochs in the first file to one fifth and all
 epochs in the second to one half of their respective original sampling
 frequencies and then averages them.
 Obviously this `branch skipping' feature should be used with due diligence
 because it is easy to produce epochs with varying geometry in the output;
 Some methods cannot handle the case in which the number of channels varies
 across epochs and others (like the average method) cannot handle varying
 epoch lengths.
 Another point to be aware of is that although the syntactic parsing of
 all lines is done before any execution of the script is started, the actual
 initialization of a branch takes place only after the prior branches are
 exhausted and thus possibly after a lot of processing has already been
 done; for example, `
\family typewriter
file1.asc
\family default
' in the script above would be processed even if `
\family typewriter
file2.asc
\family default
' was missing, failing with an error message only when trying to access
 `
\family typewriter
file2.asc
\family default
'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One more advanced feature is `disguising' a transform method as `Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Metho
d' by prepending an exclamation mark (`!').
 The reason for this construct is that there is sometimes the need to output
 messages or to run programs safely 
\shape italic
between
\shape default
 the processing of two branches.
 Message output can be used by a subsequent program to separate data resulting
 from different files within an output stream - for example when multiple
 input files are measured using the 
\series bold
write_crossings
\series default
 method writing to standard output.
 It is obvious that only methods like 
\series bold
echo
\series default
 and 
\series bold
run
\series default
, which in contrast to most transform methods do not try to access the epoch
 data in any way, should be disguised as `Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Method's, since all
 data pointers are initialized to NULL, causing an exception when accessed.
 Clearly, a `disguised' method will only be called once and never yield
 any valid epoch – if a transform method does not touch the data, pointers
 will remain NULL, indicating to the executor that the method has no epoch
 to deliver.

Multiple sub-scripts in one script file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Since August 1997, multiple scripts as described above (`sub-scripts') can
 be appended to a single text file (which is still called a `script').
 The sub-script separator is a line starting with a dash `-'.
 The rest of this line is ignored, so that the separator line can be extended
 to a full line of dashes to make the separation visually clearer, and to
 contain other characters and comments.
 Sub-scripts are independently executed from top to bottom.
 No global syntax check takes place before execution begins; in fact, the
 next script is not even read from the file before the execution of the
 current sub-script is finished.
 This is done in order to allow a controlling program to start 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 only once and request operations on demand by writing more sub-scripts
 to it (i.e., 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 reads scripts from a so-called 
\shape italic
pipe
\shape default
).
 Multiple sub-scripts are also helpful since arbitrary sequential operations
 necessary for a task can be specified in a single script.
 The 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 program itself (the `user interface', see below) also allows to select
 one sub-script to execute, so that a script file can also be used as a
 library of operations.
 This can also be useful for `standalone' versions of the program with built-in
 script.

Protecting white space in arguments by backslashes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Since August 2000, it is possible to protect white space (space and tab
 characters) in scripts by preceding them with a backslash (`
\backslash
').
 This is necessary because otherwise, white space is taken to separate arguments.
 The most obvious uses of backslash protection are to select channels by
 name whose names contain blanks, and to read or write files with names
 containing blanks.
 An actual backslash can be specified by a sequence of two backslashes.
 In order to avoid `backslash orgies', 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 leaves backslashes not followed by either white space or another backslash
 intact - channel selection, for example, uses backslashes to protect hyphens
 from being interpreted as range indicators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Remarks about the program design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The `configurable data analyzer' approach has several advantages: The analysis
 modules implementing the `methods' are independent of the data source or
 output formats, which means that testing a data analysis procedure is possible
 without compiling the methods into a test version of the program and without
 having to generate test data externally, because Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Methods are
 available that generate test data.
 The program can also be easily maintained because there is no need to keep
 track of several single utilities and versions; and it is easy to add more
 methods anytime, steadily increasing the abilities of the program without
 sacrificing any of the former functionality.
 For example, only an input and an output method need to be added for full
 support of another file format.
 Finally, the `methods' are independent compiled objects and can be linked
 with and called from other programs without using scripts at all (an example
 in the distribution is 
\series bold
ascaverage
\series default
, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Sec:ascaverage"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are, on the other hand, also disadvantages: Most users are familiar
 with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

document-centric
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 user interface design in which a multichannel data file is displayed as
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

document
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and menus are offered to perform processing steps on it.
 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 does not follow this standard but rather views the script as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

document
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, similar to a text editor.
 Therefore users have to familiarize with the script concept to use the
 program.
 To many users, for example, it is not obvious why 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 cannot 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

look back
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into features of the original file while processing goes on.
 The reason is of course the design decision of modularity and independence
 of the processing methods.
 Thus, other methods besides Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Methods only see whatever data is
 stored in memory to represent the epoch.
 This appears to limit the scope of tasks for which 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 can be used, but on the other hand surprisingly few tasks have surfaced
 which could not be solved with 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 – Since no programming is necessary, at least a few important and otherwise
 cumbersome processing steps can always be implemented as an 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One more annotation appears necessary: Today, a large number of methods
 have been written for 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
.
 Some of them, like 
\series bold
posplot
\series default
 or the sound I/O methods, add significantly to the size of the program
 because they are built on top of graphics/sound libraries that are large
 by themselves.
 This is not a problem on Unix systems, since 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 is usually compiled using shared libraries.
 However, if size is a problem and a version of 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 will be used only for a limited number of tasks, it is very easy to build
 versions of 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 containing any subset of the available methods.
 This means that a compiled version of 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 may or may not include all of the methods described below.
 A quite detailed description of the included methods is available in every
 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 binary and can be requested from the program as described in the next section.

 These arguments replace strings of the form `$

\shape default
' in the pre-parsed script in a way similar to the access to command-line
 parameters in many script languages, i.e.
 `$1' expands to the first additional argument and so on.
 It is an error if less such script arguments are available than requested
 in the script, but only a warning results if more arguments are available
 than requested.
 Note that the script argument expansion

\begin_layout Plain Layout
script argument expansion
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is 
\shape italic
not

 done prior to parsing the script, but rather the selected method parameters
 are replaced within the `precompiled' version.
 Therefore it is not possible to replace a method name or an option switch
 with a `$

 This was designed so that argument expansion could work in exactly the

\begin_layout Standard
After the main program was used successfully for data analysis for some
 years, it became obvious that using a configurable general-purpose system
 was an `overkill' for some small, conversion-type applications.
 Even a complicated analysis may call for a fixed monolithic command if
 its execution belongs to the laboratory routine.
 For such purposes, a way was devised to produce compiled 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 binaries with a built-in script.
 The compilable script, consisting of C data structures, is dumped into
 a source file using a normal version of 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
.
 Dumping in this fashion is necessary in order to detect syntactic problems
 in the script and to include only the methods and support modules necessary
 for the given script.
 Standalone versions of 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default

 options and a 
\series bold
-D

 option that reconstructs the built-in script from the compiled data structures,
 so that it is always possible to see which actions a standalone version
 will perform.
 Otherwise, standalone versions only take script arguments, i.e.
 arguments that will be passed to methods as defined in the script.
 Obviously and just as desired, users of standalone versions will generally
 not need this manual.

 Information about available methods must be requested from the help function

 a window that allows to interactively select the actions to perform.
 For 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
, this includes the construction of scripts from the available methods as
 well as loading, saving, starting and interrupting such scripts.
 The single main reason for implementing a GUI version (named

) was that the interactive data plotting method 
\series bold
posplot
\series default
 could only work reasonably under MS Windows (opening a new window) if the
 main application was itself a native Windows application.
 The functionality of 
\series bold
posplot
\series default
 is essential for 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 because it allows direct scrutiny of the data at any processing step.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An interactive application turned out to be also quite helpful for the initial
 creation of scripts (less so for production runs, which are done in `batch
 mode' most of the time), avoiding the loop between consulting the help
 function built into 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
, editing the script using a text editor and running 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
.
 First, a graphical representation of methods as `icons' was considered.
 But it was desirable to use 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
-compatible scripts as the save and restore format to be able to use such
 scripts interchangeably with the command line version.
 If all aspects of 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 scripts such as comments, multiple sub-scripts and multiple Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Methods
 with `branch processing' should be supported, the clearest design appeared
 to be to display the script file in a text editor window with special features,
 such as changing arguments and options of a method via interactive form
 dialogs.
 This has the advantage of allowing comments in a natural way and also allowing
 changes to be done directly in the script wherever this is more comfortable
 to the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
avg_q_ui
\series default
 and 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 work with the same method modules.
 Both only have a list of methods which they can ask for more information,
 such as method type, argument descriptors and the method description text.
 Error-handling and tracing use callbacks to the main program.
 In this way it is guaranteed that a change to a method (or the addition
 of a method, for that matter) is immediately propagated to all user interfaces
 and that scripts always execute identically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described, 
\series bold
avg_q_ui
\series default
 was implemented as a text editor with special features.
 Besides the functionality of a simple text editor, it is possible to insert
 a new method (
\shape italic
before
\shape default
 the current line) by selecting a method from the menu.
 There is one menu for each of the method types.
 A dialog with all options and arguments for the selected method will appear,
 allowing a successful termination only after all formally required fields
 are filled out: This dialog is actually a view into the precompiled (configured
) ready-to-execute method structure.
 Each method usually has reasonable defaults for some or all of the fields.
 Options have a check box in front which indicates whether or not the option
 is activated, while required arguments just present the text, number or
 filename input.
 Filename input fields have a `select' button to the right side which causes
 a file selector box to appear.
 When the `OK' button is pressed, the text representation of the form just
 filled out is inserted into the script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By pressing the 
\series bold
right mouse button
\series default
 or the 
\series bold
TAB key
\series default
 within the text window, the current method line is displayed as a dialog
 box with the current values filled in.
 When the first word in the line is not a recognized method name, 
\series bold
avg_q_ui
\series default
 tries to find a method starting with that word.
 Then, the method is configured using the rest of the line as arguments;
 if this configuration fails (wrong number of arguments, unrecognized options,
 etc.), default argument values are substituted just as for methods selected
 from the menu.
 The values can be changed as above, and the `OK' button will replace the
 old line with the new one in the script.
 Finally, only the script text is relevant; the conversion between text
 and form dialog, i.e.
 compiling and de-compiling, only serves the purpose of specifying method
 lines correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Variables
\shape default
 ($1, $2 \SpecialChar ldots
) can be used in scripts and receive their startup values from
 the command line in the same way as for 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
.
 However, the question arises in which way their values can be modified
 or added interactively.
 The approach chosen for 
\series bold
avg_q_ui
\series default
 is to show the 
\shape italic
contents
\shape default
 of the addressed variable in the method configuration dialog box.
 If, for example, a filename is replaced by $1 in a script and the command
 line does not give $1 a value, the dialog box will display an empty field.
 Any value entered in this field will be written into the variable $1 ready
 to be used by the script, instead of inserting it in place of the $1.
 In this way the dialog box always shows the values that will actually be
 used but not the variable identifiers.
 It is implied that variable identifiers must sometimes be entered using
 the text editor instead of the method dialog box, since not all input elements
 that can be set to a variable have input fields suitable to enter an identifier
 (e.g.
 choice boxes).

The following keyboard shortcuts are defined in combination with the `CTRL'

\begin_layout Description

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While a script runs, the name of the method currently executed is shown
 on the status line of the window together with the script number and line.
 In case of a configuration or run-time error, the cursor will be placed
 on the line at which the error occurred, with the status line containing
 the error message.
 Trace messages and warnings are written to a second text window that appears
 only after the first line is written to it.
 The trace level can be set via the menu as well as a simple single-step
 mode which causes a dialog box to appear before each method is executed.
 The 
\series bold
posplot
\series default
 method opens a third window which makes 
\series bold
posplot
\series default
 operations available in its own menu; the rest of the interaction uses
 keyboard and mouse as described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Sec:PosplotKeys"

\end_inset

 (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "Sec:PosplotKeys"

\end_inset

).
 A feature that should be noted is that all editing operations in the script
 window, including the use of configuration dialogs, can be performed while
 a script runs.
 It is not possible to start another script, however.
 In any case, the running script executes from the compiled, internal representa
tion of the text window contents at the time at which it was started, so
 that editing has no influence on the (sub-)script currently executed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multithreading: The GUI can usually only process commands and update the
 windows within special callbacks before and after methods are executed,
 while trace messages are output, or within methods which are interactive
 by themselves such as 
\series bold
posplot
\series default
.
 This means that the GUI is non-responsive for the time in which a single
 method runs without issuing trace messages.
 The natural approach to this problem is to start the script as a separate
 `thread'.
 Such multithreaded versions of 
\series bold
avg_q_ui
\series default
 have two status lines, the left one for the GUI and the right for the script
 processor.
 Also, with these versions it is possible to either `stop' the script the
 way the single-threaded version did, namely waiting for the current method
 to finish its operation; or, which is more insecure, to `cancel' the script
 by killing the script thread.
 In both cases, however, the program will attempt to execute the normal
 exit operations of each method in the queue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides presenting a graphical user interface, 
\series bold
avg_q_ui
\series default
 understands the same options and arguments given on the command line as
 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
, including the script name and values for script variables.
 If the name of a script is given, the default behavior is to immediately
 execute it and terminate after successful completion just as 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 would.
 Interactive mode is only entered in case of an error or if the user interrupts
 the script.
 It is possible to force 
\series bold
avg_q_ui
\series default
 to start in interactive mode showing the given script by using the option
 
\series bold
-I
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally it should be mentioned that dumping a script as compilable C code
 is also supported by 
\series bold
avg_q_ui
\series default
, that this output is the same as for 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
, and that corresponding `standalone' versions of 
\series bold
avg_q_ui
\series default
 with compiled-in script can be produced.
 Such standalone versions take values for variables from the command line
 as usual, but if variables are missing or the middle or right mouse button
 is pressed in interactive mode, dialog boxes are shown in which the variable
 values can be entered or modified.

'.
 There are two versions: an ASCII text version and a binary version that
 is faster to read and write and should normally be used for intermediate
 storage.
 The two versions contain identical information.
 They are automatically recognized on reading; special options are only
 needed to request that binary format is written instead of the default
 ASCII.
 The file format has the following capabilities: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The file header stores any number of `feature=value' pairs on individual
 lines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Any number of epochs with the following attributes: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An epoch descriptor text (comment) that usually contains information about
 the experiment the data came from and the names of the processing steps
 applied to it.
 Additionally, a textual z axis label and a numerical `z value' (like `Lat[ms]=5
0') may be contained in this descriptor.
 The comment may be preceded by `feature=value;' pairs containing properties
 local to the current epoch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each epoch has its own list of channel names and positions as well as its
 own data size descriptors.
 The `channel name' associated with the additional `x-value' column usually
 specifies the name and unit of the x data as mentioned above for the z
 axis label.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The data in each epoch is organized as a data table with the channels as
 the columns and any number of rows that are associated with x-values.
 On each channel 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 x-value field, multiple data entries (`items') may exist, forming a data
 tuple.
 The tuple size is fixed for the whole epoch.
 Multiple items are used e.g.
 to store real and imaginary parts of spectral coefficients or statistical
 information for each data point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The `feature=value' pairs mentioned above are used to store information
 that might be used for processing or ignored; e.g.
 the total number of epochs that lead to this result (the `nrofaverages'
 property used for statistical analysis: Nr_of_averages=#) or the number
 of items in each field that are protected from normal numerical processing
 (such as counts: Leaveright=#).
 Also, epoch trigger information is written, if present, as a Triggers=
 field.
\begin_inset Newline newline

Many Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Methods read epochs from continuous files around arbitrary
 time points.
 By default such time points or triggers are read from file format specific
 internal representations if available.
 In addition, a simple ASCII trigger file format is supported by 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 in order to represent trigger lists externally.
 Each trigger has an integer number or `trigger code' assigned to it.
 In trigger files
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
trigger file format
\end_layout

\end_inset

, lines beginning with a hash `#' are comments and skipped; otherwise, each
 line should contain a pair of values of the form `point code' giving the
 point number around which to read and the trigger code assigned to this
 point.
 The column separators can be either spaces or tabs (tabs preferred).
 Any further columns appearing in the file (`description') are read and
 written transparently, and displayed by posplot, but not used for epoch
 selection.
 This feature is, for example, used by 
\series bold
write_crossings -E
\series default
, which creates a third column containing the measured value of the extremum.
 The point number is the sampling point number relative to the first point
 in the file, starting with 0.
 It can be given in time units by the general convention below (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Sec:Point_and_time_units"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A trigger code of 0 (`point' being irrelevant) signals the end of the trigger
 list just as the End of File does.
 This is useful when, instead of an actual file name, `stdin' is used as
 a trigger file name.
 This will read trigger lines from standard input.
 Usually, no End of File condition is desired on the standard input stream;
 instead, the end of the trigger list is marked by a zero trigger code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This might be a good moment to note that representation of triggers or markers
 is one of the big incompatibility issues between data formats.
 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 alone cannot solve these issues completely.
 While triggers represented as lists (most often appended to the end of
 the raw continuous data) can be handled relatively efficiently and are
 even internally kept with each epoch and written to some output formats,
 especially the surprisingly common storage in dedicated `marker channels'
 is tedious to deal with.
 The detection of steps or peaks in such channels is a signal processing
 task in its own right rather than an aid for analysis.
 Of course, dedicated 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 methods for a given file format handle their specific trigger format (one
 or several trigger `channels', binary trigger lists appended to the file
 or stored separately and so forth); When dealing with random access to
 data segments, however, extra steps may be needed to produce an ASCII trigger
 list first.

 can take a list of channel names

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 as an argument.
 Such channel lists have several features and are generally denoted as `channeln
ames' in the argument lists.
 The channel names in the list must be separated by commas; white space
 is not allowed.
 A range of channels ending in consecutive numbers, such as `E2,E3,E4' may
 be abbreviated using a hyphen, as `E2-E4'.
 If hyphens or commas belong to a channel name, they must be protected by
 preceding them with a backslash (`
\backslash
').
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Normally, it is a fatal error if any of the named channels does not exist.
 This behavior can be relaxed by preceding the whole list with a question
 mark.
 For example, `?M12,E30-E128' selects any of the named channels that are
 found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expansion of numbers in channel names zero-pads each output number to
 the length of the first number, so that `E001-E200' yields the expected
 result.
 `E001-E1000' is zero-padded only up to length 3 but not to length 4, just
 as `E1-E29' is not padded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An exclamation mark prefix `!' negates the selection: `!?M1-M11,E1-E29'
 selects all channels that do not bear one of the names in the list.
 At this point, a few remarks about channel order and channels with equal
 names should be made.
 The `positive' list (without the exclamation mark) determines an order
 of the channels: For example, if channels should be copied (
\series bold
remove_channel -k
\series default
), the order in which they will appear in the output multichannel data set
 is the order in which channels are mentioned in the list.
 However, with negative lists and within sets of channels with equal names,
 the order is determined by their sequence in the original data set.
 For example, if a data set contains channels M1
\begin_inset Formula $_{\mathrm{a}}$
\end_inset

, M2
\begin_inset Formula $_{\mathrm{a}}$
\end_inset

, M1
\begin_inset Formula $_{\mathrm{b}}$

 Obviously, the data dimension is defined by the numbers of channels, points
 per channel and items per point.
 The sampling rate (sfreq) is mandatory.
 Additionally, channel name and position information is mandatory (positions
 being defined in three dimensions but often using only the first two dimensions
 for a flat screen layout).
 All Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen

 holding x axis values, is not mandatory; However it is generated when needed
 using a standard routine.
 The metadata involved is sfreq, beforetrig and aftertrig.
 These three values are sufficient to create a default epoch-local time
 axis.
 A heuristic based upon the sampling rate is used to determine the time
 unit (µs, ms, s, min or h, the same as in

 when used to process raw data, these parameters will often remain constant

 An

Since a complete data set in memory always includes channel names and positions
 but not all supported file formats contain this information, the corresponding
 methods construct reasonable defaults; as last resort, the channel names
 are set to numbers starting with 1 and the positions are set to a regular
 grid in the x-y plane at z=0.

 of a specific frequency or a randomly fluctuating amplitude.
 Each dipole is defined by seven arguments; if they are missing, they are

All `times' specified here are in time points.
 Every dipole is started (the harmonic contents with random phase as above)

 Within this duration, the starting ramp (a factor varying linearly between
 0 and 1) is `risetime' points wide and the ending ramp `falltime' points.
 The only difference between harmonic and noise dipoles here is the time
 series that is subjected to this envelope.

.
 The variant of this format without .coa file (see below) does not include
 channel names or positions, and codes the data as short integer values.
 However, 
\series bold
read_freiburg
\series default
 supplies channel names automatically depending on the number of channels
 employed.
 Channel positions can then be set using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

set_channelposition =PSG
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If no setup for the given number of channels is known, the channels are
 named by number and arranged on a grid.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If the Inputfile argument specifies the name of a directory, (compressed)
 single trials are read from separate files arranged in its subdirectories.
 The names of the subdirectories are constructed from the name of the directory
 by appending numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $00-99$
\end_inset

, and each subdirectory holds up to 100 trials whose names are made up of
 the (lowercase) last letter of the directory name, the digits of the subdirecto
ry and two more digits 
\begin_inset Formula $00-99$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If the Inputfile argument is the name of a file, then this file is read
 as an average (uncompressed single epoch).
 The nr_of_channels argument is only used for average files, since the informati
on is missing from these.
 In this case, the number of points in the epoch is computed from the file
 length.
 The nrofaverages property is correctly read from averaged files.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If the option -c is given, an epoch length must be specified instead of
 nr_of_channels, and the file is treated as a continuous (sleep) file (cf.
 
\series bold
write_freiburg
\series default
).
 First, the method looks for Inputfile; if it finds it, it is opened as
 an OS/9 sleep file.
 If not, it looks for Inputfile.co, which is opened as an MSDOS sleep file.
 If the (text) file Inputfile.coa is also found (cf.
 
\series bold
write_freiburg
\series default
), then channel names and sensitivities are read from this file and the
 data will have the unit microvolts.
 If it is not found, a warning message is issued and the output consists
 of the raw integer values just as in the case of the OS/9 variant.
 Sleep files are different from the single trial format in that all data
 sections are written consecutively to a single file and represent a continuous
 recording.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

File repair issues: Due to erroneous storage media or programs, the files
 in the ERP format variant were often damaged.
 Quite often, the sampling frequency is not correctly set in the header;
 it can be set with option -s.
 Option -z is a workaround for some files that had zeros inserted as every
 513th data point.
 Such points in which all channels are zero are tested for and skipped if
 this option is given; a warning message is issued if any points were actually
 omitted.
 And if data must be read that lacks a header at all, the number of channels
 must be given explicitly with option -C and a file offset to start at with
 -R.
 The latter must usually be adjusted by trial and error to have the channels
 on their correct positions\SpecialChar ldots

 Generic get-epoch method to read only the data part of files in which data
 is stored in successive elements of a known type.
 Since no header is read, all meta-information must be given by arguments
 or options.
 data_type can be uint8, int8, int16, int32, float32, float64 or string.
 Here, `uint8' is an unsigned character.
 If aftertrig is set to zero in continuous mode, then the whole file is
 read as a single epoch.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The `string' data type provides some ability to read data from text files.
 The numbers are read from the file successively.
 Any character that cannot belong to a number (as [+-0-9.eEdD]) is a valid
 separator.
 One or more consecutive separators separate two numbers.
 The end-of-line character is only special in that a line beginning with
 a hash sign (`#') is skipped.
 Triggering and `fromepoch' selection do not work on text files, because
 they would have to be completely processed in order to determine which
 data point starts where in the file.
 If triggering is needed, the text file should first be read continuously
 with this method and stored in some binary format.
 The last issue with the `string' data type is that the number of values
 in the file must be exactly a multiple of the epoch size; otherwise a fatal
 read error will result in the last epoch (this does not occur for the binary
 types because here the number of complete epochs can be calculated from
 the file size).
 This read error can still be avoided by limiting the number of epochs attempted
 to be read using the `-e' option.

 Get-epoch method to read the NeuroFile II format by Nihon Kohden.
 This is a binary format using one byte per sampled value that codes a differenc
e to the preceding value.
 The binary data is stored in a file whose name ends in `.eeg', while descriptive
 data is stored in another file with the extension `.dsc'.
 Thus, the `Inputfile' argument to 
\series bold
read_\SpecialChar softhyphen
neuro\SpecialChar softhyphen
file
\series default
 should be given without extension.
 Note that 
\series bold
read_\SpecialChar softhyphen
neuro\SpecialChar softhyphen
file
\series default
 always uses the last values in the preceding epoch as starting point for
 the difference procedure for the next epoch, which is only correct if the
 data is read continuously instead of using a trigger file.
 The uncertainty about the level of the first data point, however, is introduced
 by the data format.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Besides the `fast' channels whose data is stored in the `.eeg' files, there
 may also be some `slow' channels sampled at a fixed rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $256/30$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Hz whose data is stored in a file with extension `.cpl'.
 If desired, these files can be read using

 with data type `int16', Intel byte order.

 formats continuous (.CNT), epoched (.EEG) or averaged (.AVG).
 The method infers the actual file type from the file header, so that the
 file name does not matter.
 It must be noted that there are presently four different continuous formats
 that I know of (`CONT0', `100/330 kHz', `DCMES' and `SynAmps') and that
 are supported by 
\series bold
read_synamps
\series default
.
 The main difference is in the way triggers are stored: `CONT0' and `DCMES'
 have special trigger traces (2 and 1, respectively), while the other formats
 have an event table.
 In continuous and epoched format files, the data is coded as short integer
 values (16 bit resolution) and a float sensitivity for each channel; for
 the averaged format, it is coded as floats.
 Irrespective of the internal format differences, 
\series bold
read_synamps
\series default
 reads all variants transparently.
\begin_inset Separator latexpar

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Channel names and channel positions (x-y screen arrangement) are read from
 the file.
 For the continuous formats, epochs are read around each trigger present
 in the trigger trace(s) or included in the event table.
 The codes for different NeuroScan event types (`StimType', `KeyBoard',
 `KeyPad' and `Accept') are mapped to a single value in the following way:
 `StimType' codes are positive between 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $255$

, `KeyPad' codes are negative between 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$

 and `KeyBoard'+1 codes negative multiplied by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $16$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout
On February 12, 2004 the fact that Scan 4 introduced all-zero events to
 represent F2 while F1 is reserved to the help system lead to the change
 that now `KeyBoard'+1 is coded here; Codes previously seen as 
\begin_inset Formula $-16$
\end_inset

 are now 
\begin_inset Formula $-32$
\end_inset

 and so forth.
 The previous mapping of Scan 4 F2 events to 
\begin_inset Formula $-256$
\end_inset

 does no longer occur.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The key F2 pressed on the Scan 3 EEG recording system corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $-(3*16)$
\end_inset

 while it is 
\begin_inset Formula $-(1*16)$
\end_inset

 if inserted by Scan 4.
 In addition, the somewhat ill-defined `Accept' field can have the value
 ACCEPT or REJECT, in which case it codes an attribute of the current trigger
 interpreted accordingly if option -r is given, or it may represent an event
 in its own right if no other codes are set, namely a Start/Stop event (translat
ed to code 
\begin_inset Formula $256$
\end_inset

), a DC offset correction event (translated to 
\begin_inset Formula $257$
\end_inset

), or the start and end of a reject block (translated to 
\begin_inset Formula $258$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $259$
\end_inset

, respectively).
 A Start/Stop event is present at the end of each continuous file and at
 the points at which acquisition was interrupted.
 The inclusion of these special events in the stream of normal triggers
 means that using the option -t is always recommended with continuous files
 in order to restrict triggering to the intended events.
 Combinations of codes cannot occur because simultaneous events of different
 type are split into distinct events by

 In epoched or averaged formats, no event table is available, epochs have
 a limited length and a defined time zero within the epoch.
 beforetrig and aftertrig times count from this point backward and forward,
 respectively, a value of zero being interpreted as request to extend the
 epoch to the corresponding limit in the file.
 Since an averaged file only contains a single epoch, any epoch-restricting
 options (-f, -e, -t) are ignored for such files.

 Currently 'simple binary' export format versions 2, 4 and 6 are supported
 (short integer, float and double samples).
 Triggers can be contained in specialized channels, with each channel coding
 for only one event type (or condition).
 The rising ramp of a trigger signal in trigger channel 1 is interpreted
 as an event with condition code 1 and so on.
 No channel name or position information is available.

 mainly supports the so-called `reconfigured Vitaport II format' in which
 certain header extensions are present and in which the data is stored non-inter

 with the data from each channel stored separately.
 Raw Vitaport II format (the format in which the data is originally stored
 on the PCMCIA cards of the portable system) can only be read in continuous
 mode.
 All channels are automatically resampled to the highest sampling rate present
 in the file.
 Channel name information is available.
 A special channel with the name `MARKER' is used for the triggers, and
 the trigger code is the level to which the flank raises.

comparison is any one of: == != < <= > >= =~ !~ (equal, not equal, less
 than, less or equal, greater, greater or equal, matching, not matching)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

value is the value to compare with; comparison follows the type of the variable,
 i.e.
 alphabetical with string variables, as integer with integer numerical variables
 and so on.
 Matching can be read as `contains' for string variables; for numerical
 values, it is the same as equality.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For example, this method can be used to assert that all processed epochs
 have a certain number of channels or consist of at least a given number
 of averages when creating grand averages.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The `firstvalue' assertion accesses the very first value of the

 the first data point and item of the first channel.
 
\series bold

 and

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The `channelname' assertion is special in that the condition is evaluated
 on every single channel.
 In order to succeed, the comparison must be met by at least one channel
 for the == comparison and on all channels for all other comparisons.
\begin_inset Newline newline

The `failed_\SpecialChar softhyphen

 by counting how many previous assertions failed.

bandwidth
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Rejection method to reject epochs in which any channel equals or exceeds
 a given bandwidth (max-min value).
 This is most often needed to exclude raw data epochs with large-amplitude
 artifacts from further processing.
 However, the choice can also be inverted using the option -I, thus selectively
 choosing epochs with high bandwidth.
 Using the option -m, it is also possible to use the absolute maximum as
 the criterion rather than the bandwidth.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The bandwidth can be Inf, in which cases epochs are rejected containing
 +Inf or -Inf.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The option -C specifies that the rejection should act not on the whole epoch,
 but rather only on the channels exceeding their specified thresholds, causing
 these channels to be deleted from the epoch.
 In this case, the option -I also inverts the selection, i.e.
 all channels 
\shape italic
not
\shape default
 exceeding their thresholds are deleted.
 The whole epoch is only rejected if no channel would remain.
 It should be clear that changing numbers of channels are somewhat exceptional;
 the further processing steps have to be carefully chosen.
 For example, using the 
\series bold
average
\series default
 method without the option -M will result in an error message (option -M
 tells it to match channels by name).
 Most output data formats cannot handle changing numbers of channels (the
 Readasc format does).
 One of the meaningful postprocessing steps would be to use 
\series bold
collapse_channels
\series default
 without arguments to average across the remaining channels, producing a
 single channel in any case.

\end_inset

 Method to add to all points in the the incoming epochs either a constant
 value (if no command but a value is given), the negative of the map mean
 (command=`negmean'), of the map minimum (`negmin') or map maximum (`negmax').
 Variations that work on channels rather than on maps are called `negpointmean',
 `negpointmin' and `negpointmax'.
 As an example, 
\series bold
add negpointmin
\series default
 followed by 
\series bold
scale_by invpointmax
\series default
 will map all the data, for each channel individually, to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 Things like this are often needed for threshold detection tasks, e.g.
 using the 
\series bold
write_crossings
\series default
 method.
 Similarly, an arbitrary quantile can be added using command=`negquantile'
 with a value set to the quantile desired (
\begin_inset Formula $[0,\mathrm{1}]$
\end_inset

).
 If command=`noise', random values evenly distributed in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[-\mathrm{value},\mathrm{value}]$
\end_inset

 are added to each input value

 command=`gaussnoise' adds zero-centered Gaussian noise with value as the
 standard deviation.
 Finally, if command=`triggers', then the trigger code is added to all (selected
) channels at the latency indicated by each respective trigger.
 The most obvious use for this feature is to add (one point wide) trigger
 spikes to an all-zero channel to serve as a trigger channel for software
 which needs triggers in such a form.

 Transform method to add channels, points or items from the asc file add_channel
s_file.
 The number of points and items (resp.: channels and items or channels and
 points) in add_\SpecialChar softhyphen
channels_\SpecialChar softhyphen
file must be identical to that in the epoch currently
 in memory.
 If channels are added, the new channels are imported together with their
 names and positions.
 All file information like sampling rate, baseline offset etc.
 is taken from the epoch in memory.
 Appending sampling points or items rather than channels is done by 
\series bold
add_channels
\series default
 as well (options 
\series bold
-p
\series default
 or 
\series bold
-i
\series default
) because these are technically very similar operations on the data matrix.
 Option 
\series bold
-l
\series default
 causes a similar operation to 
\series bold
append -l
\series default
: The epoch from add_\SpecialChar softhyphen
channels_\SpecialChar softhyphen
file is linked in memory at the end of the
 current list or stack of data sets and will be displayed as separate data
 set by 
\series bold
posplot
\series default
.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

By using the 
\series bold
-n
\series default
 switch, an arbitrary combination of channels from the add_\SpecialChar softhyphen
channels_\SpecialChar softhyphen
file
 can be specified for addition (this option has no effect in combination
 with 
\series bold
-l
\series default
, though).
 As usual, the channels are treated in the order given in the channelnames
 list and channels can be mentioned multiple times.
 If adding points or items, the number of chosen channels must equal the
 number of channels in the current epoch.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

By default, the epoch from add_\SpecialChar softhyphen
channels_\SpecialChar softhyphen
file is not advanced when processing
 multiple epochs; this means that the same data is appended to each incoming
 epoch.
 This behavior was chosen to be similar to that of the 
\series bold

 method and can be changed with the option 
\series bold

 transform method to apply elementwise transformations to the input data.
 The behavior of the functions acting on single floating-point values is
 to apply the function on all items of each input element except the `leaveright
' last items.
 Functions acting on multiple items (like the complex functions) are applied
 only once per element.
 The -i option specifies the number of the first item to use in this case.
 In no case does the 
\series bold

 method change the item count of the current epoch.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

As usual, `exp' denotes the exponential to the natural basis 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

.
 `logdB' calculates the amplification (
\begin_inset Formula $dB>0$
\end_inset

) or attenuation (
\begin_inset Formula $dB<0$
\end_inset

) of power in Decibels.
 Because 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 cannot know whether the values represent amplitude or power, the latter
 is assumed (note that logdB is just 
\begin_inset Formula $10\cdot$
\end_inset

log10).
 `inv' calculates the inverse, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0/x$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline

`ceil', `floor' and `rint' round to the next higher, lower or the nearest
 integer, respectively.
\begin_inset Newline newline

The complex functions returning real values (abs2, square2, phase) follow
 the notion of complex-valued output, i.e.
 they set the second item (the imaginary part) to 0.
 
\series bold
extract_item
\series default
 can be used to make the real-part item the only one if this is desired.
 The absandphase function outputs absolute value and phase in the two items.
 The coherence function returns the same value in the first item as abs2,
 but assumes that the input is a complex coherency and calculates the probabilit
y 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of the resulting coherence 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=(1-Z)^{L-1}$
\end_inset

 (cf.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the number of independent sections from which the coherency was formed
 by averaging and is assumed to be 
\begin_inset Formula $2\cdot nrofaverages$
\end_inset

, which is correct if the 
\series bold
fftspect
\series default
 overlap parameter was 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 The norm2 function normalizes the complex values.
\begin_inset Newline newline

The functions working on three or four statistical items are intended to
 be used on data as created by either the 
\series bold
average
\series default
 or the 
\series bold
subtract

 method with the options -t and -u or similarly by the 
\series bold
ascaverage
\series default
 command (see page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "Sec:ascaverage"

\end_inset

).
 They neither use nor modify the first (average) item.
 The second and third items, together with the `nrofaverages' parameter,
 are used by `ttest' to calculate t and two-tailed p values for the t-test
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 against zero, and by `stddev' to calculate the empirical standard deviation
 of the original ensemble and the standard error of the average (with 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 degrees of freedom).
 The nrofaverages parameter may be given on a by-point basis in a fourth
 item as output by the 
\series bold

 The number of points by which the filter window is shifted between steps
 by sliding_step.
 The output x value corresponds to the middle of the window.
 At the data boundaries, the window size reduces to half of sliding_size.
 The number of output points is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{inpoints}{/}\mathrm{sliding}\_\mathrm{step}$
\end_inset

.
 sliding_step may be fractional and may also be entered as time value by
 appending time units as usual (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Sec:Point_and_time_units"

\end_inset

).
 There may be either only one channel in convolve_file or as many channels
 as in the current epoch; in case of one channel, the same wave form is
 used for all input channels, otherwise each input channel is convolved
 with the corresponding convolve_file channel.
 Note that x-axis data, if available, is not convolved but a simple sliding
 window average is performed.

correlate
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This method implements linear operations on incoming time courses, treating
 the data for each channel as a vector in a space with as many dimensions
 as there are time points.
 The 
\series bold
project
\series default
 method does the same for maps.
 The general procedure consists of two parts: A scalar multiplication between
 each data vector (time course) and each of a number of projection time
 courses read from an asc file (correlate_file), and subsequently, if requested,
 a reconstruction of time courses of the original length using the coefficients
 obtained in the first step.
 The time courses are read from the specified channels of correlate_file,
 possibly from multiple epochs (by default only from the first epoch).
 Thus, the number of correlation time courses, and also the number of obtained
 coefficients, is (correlate_file channels
\begin_inset Formula $\cdot$
\end_inset

epochs).
 The number of points in the correlate_file must equal that in the current
 epoch.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The operation carried out by default is a scalar multiplication between
 the input time courses 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 and the normalized correlate_file time courses 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}=P_{i}/|P_{i}|$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{i}=I\cdot N_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The output coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{i}$
\end_inset

 are stored in successive output points.
 In subspace mode (option -s), the reconstruction step mentioned above takes
 place.
 The projection time courses are summed up weighted with the coefficients
 from the first step, yielding an output with the same number of points
 as the input had.
 Similarly, a subtraction of this projection from the raw data can be done
 (which is equivalent to the projection onto the orthogonal space of the
 subspace) to suppress components with a known time course.

 It is possible to specify any number of ranges to omit from the fit by

If the option -o is given, no actual detrending is done, but the constant
 value found at the given latency is subtracted from all points.

fftfilter:

status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fftfilter
\end_layout

\end_inset

 transform method to filter the signals by performing a Fourier transform,
 suppressing specified ranges of the Fourier coefficients and transforming
 the signals back into the time domain.
 Since a filter should usually not be infinitely steep in the frequency
 domain, the frequency ranges to suppress are not just specified by their
 starting and ending frequencies but by two values for each end of the range
 that tell at which frequency the change in the suppression coefficient
 should start to `fade in' and at which frequency the target suppression
 should be reached.
 The interpolation was chosen to be linear.
 An arbitrary number of suppression blocks may be given; Each block contains
 four ascending numbers between 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0$
\end_inset

 that specify frequencies relative to half the sampling frequency: start,
 zerostart, zeroend, end.
 Frequencies can also be entered in Hz by appending the string `Hz', e.g.
 48.2Hz.
 The transmission 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 between start and zerostart is 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 by default but can be specified.
 Between start and zerostart the transmission varies linearly from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and between zeroend and end from 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 If the suppression should start at 0Hz (i.e., the first block represents
 a high pass), zerostart and zeroend can both be set to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

; similarly, the last block can extend to half the sampling frequency (i.e.,
 represent a low pass) by setting both zeroend and end to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 These are usually the only cases in which an infinitely steep ramp should
 be chosen.
 In all other cases, it is desirable to let the ramps span at least two
 Fourier coefficients, which means that the difference between the start
 and end frequencies should at least be 
\begin_inset Formula $2/T$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~

Hz, where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

 is the epoch length in seconds.

 Transform method to perform the Laplacian operation on the incoming epochs.
 The algorithm is roughly constructed after 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Le:94"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: The electrode set is triangulated and those points around which a closed
 path can be constructed are used for a local planar surface.
 The Taylor- expansion parameters (the planar derivatives up to second order)
 are then estimated by solving a set of linear equations by SVD backsubstitution.
 The sum of the second-order derivatives is output as the Laplacian estimation.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 denotes the potential, the result is an estimation for 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}P/dx^{2}+d^{2}P/dy^{2}$
\end_inset

 at each electrode.
 For electrodes at the border, no Laplacian can be estimated; these electrodes
 will be missing from the output.
 Note that bad electrodes (containing noise or deviating in sensitivity
 from the surrounding) will have large impact on all surrounding electrodes,
 so that it is better to remove such channels first.

 This method implements linear operations on incoming maps, treating the

 as there are channels.

 and each of a number of projection maps 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

 read from an asc file (project_file), and subsequently, if requested, a
 reconstruction of maps of the original dimensionality using the coefficients
 obtained in the first step.
 The maps read from project_file start at a specified data point (nr_of_point)
 and continue through successive points and then epochs as requested.
 Thus, the number of projection maps, and also the number of obtained coefficien
ts, is (epochs
\begin_inset Formula $\cdot$
\end_inset

points).
 The number of channels in the project_file should equal that in the current
 epoch.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The operation carried out by default is a scalar multiplication between
 the input maps 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 and the normalized project_file maps 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}=P_{i}/|P_{i}|$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{i}=I\cdot N_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 By default the output coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{i}$
\end_inset

 are stored in successive items and the output will be reduced to a single
 channel named `1'.
 If there are multiple items in the input already, the output contains one
 block of consecutive items for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In subspace mode (option -s), the reconstruction step mentioned above takes
 place.
 The projection maps are summed, weighted with the coefficients in the first
 step, yielding an output with the same number of channels as the input
 had.
 Even more often used than the projection onto a known subspace is the subtracti
on of this projection from the raw data (which is equivalent to the projection
 onto the orthogonal space of the known subspace unless option -N is given)
 to eliminate components with a known topography such as the EOG.
 For EOG correction, -N can be used with subtract-subspace in order to let
 only a limited number of channels determine the coefficient but yet subtract
 the the whole template weighted with the coefficient (this correction method
 is equivalent to the one implemented by NeuroScan if only the EOG channel
 is in the -N channel list).
 Thus, by itself it does NOT mean that only the mentioned channels are modified.
 To protect channels like the EMG from modification, their coefficients
 in the project_file can be set to zero in addition to excluding them from
 the -N list, or equivalently the -z option can be used.
 However, the built-in orthogonalization step will always work on all channels,
 so that additional steps may be required if orthogonalization is necessary.

 can also be used for the calculation of new channels as arbitrary linear

 Note that for the correct positions to be calculated for a given output
 file, the query method must be at a point in the processing queue where
 it sees all epochs in the shape as they are written to the file.

`filetriggers_for_trigfile' is special in that it does not access epoch-specific
 data but rather looks at the trigger list provided by many Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Methods.
 Therefore querying it will make sense for a single, possibly very small
 continuous data epoch (1 sampling point), while forcing the method to read
 the trigger list using -T (trigtransfer).
 It was added in order to be able to leverage the functionality of the Get_\SpecialChar softhyphen
Epoch

Methods, which necessarily

 This means that calling

 It is also possible to perform operations on the spectrum before reconverting

 Transform method to linearly map input to output value ranges.
 Each `block' of arguments defines an interval of data values [from\SpecialChar softhyphen
start,
 from\SpecialChar softhyphen
end] and an interval [to\SpecialChar softhyphen
start, to\SpecialChar softhyphen
end]to which data values falling into
 the first interval are linearly mapped.
 Each `block' consists of the four values fromstart, fromend, tostart and
 toend separated by white space.
 While fromend must be greater than or equal to fromstart, tostart and toend
 can also be descending numbers.
 In any case, a value of fromstart is mapped to tostart, fromend is mapped
 to toend and values in-between to according values in-between.
 If either from\SpecialChar softhyphen
start = from\SpecialChar softhyphen
end or to\SpecialChar softhyphen
start = to\SpecialChar softhyphen
end, values are mapped to
 to\SpecialChar softhyphen
start.
 The special value `Inf' can be used to denote infinity, and the special
 value `NaN' can be used to denote the undefined value.
 Since terms involving NaN obviously cannot be interpolated in any way,
 from-start and from-end must both be NaN and to-start and to-end identical
 when recoding NaN, or to-start and to-end both be NaN if recoding into
 NaN.

 Transform method to remove a single channel or ranges of channels from
 the input data.
 Channel numbers start with 1 and refer to the internal channel order.
 Multiple channel ranges can be given as ascending pairs.
 Using the -k (keep) option, it is possible to remove all but the channels
 with the given names.
 In this case, no channel_number arguments may follow, and the named channels
 are copied in the order in which they appear in the channelnames list.
 In this way, it is possible to change the physical order of channels in
 memory and even to replicate channels (if a single name appears in the
 list more than once).

 Method to scale (multiply) the incoming epochs either by a constant factor
 (any value other than `1.0', which is a deprecated former alias to `invnorm'),
 by the inverse of the map vector length (normalization, command=`invnorm'),
 by the inverse of the square map vector length (i.e.

of the sum of squares; command=`invsquarenorm'), by the inverse of the map
 sum (command=`invsum'), by the inverse of the map maximum (`invmax'), by
 the inverse of the map maximum absolute value (`invmaxabs'), by arbitrary
 quantile (`invquantile', with factor set to the desired quantile 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,\mathrm{1}]$
\end_inset

 Variations that work on channels rather than on maps are called `invpointnorm',
 `invpointsquarenorm', `invpointsum', `invpointmax', `invpointmaxabs' and
 `invpointquantile'.
 The special constants `pi' and `invpi' are also allowed, and the following

 As a special case, beforetrig_at_xvalue sets beforetrig to the index of
 the point (
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$

 For any other value, it falls back to use the standard heuristic.
 Normally this calculates the latency within the current epoch, using the

 If `abs_' is prepended (no space!) before the unit name, absolute time
 is computed using file_start_point, which is set to the starting point

 method (block filter) for smoothing and resampling.
 The number of adjacent input points for each step is determined by sliding_size
, and the number of points by which the averaging window is shifted between
 steps by sliding_step.
 The output x value corresponds to the middle of the window.
 At the data boundaries, the window size reduces to half of sliding_size.
 The number of output points is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{inpoints}{/}\mathrm{sliding}\_\mathrm{step}$
\end_inset

.
 sliding_size must be an integer value, while sliding_step may be fractional.
 This means that any target sampling frequency can be obtained (only limited
 by the fact that the output epoch must contain an integer number of points\SpecialChar ldots
)
 and upsampling is possible as well as downsampling.
 Both values may also be entered as time values by appending the time units
 as usual (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Sec:Point_and_time_units"

\end_inset

).
 In this way, the target sampling interval can be entered independently
 of the input sampling frequency: e.g.
 if sliding_step is specified as `5ms', the output will have a sampling
 frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $200$

 Method to subtract a given asc-file epoch from all incoming epochs.
 Alternatively, the asc-file epoch may also be added to the current epoch,
 the mean or weighted mean of the two epochs can be calculated (setting
 the output nrofaverages to 2 or to the sum of the input nrofaverages, respectiv
ely), or the current epoch can be multiplied or divided by the asc-file
 epoch, all in the same point-, channel and itempart-wise manner.
 For scalar products, see the 
\series bold

\series default
 method; However, the special case of complex multiplication and division
 is also supported by 
\series bold
subtract

 Note that for complex multiply and divide operations, the values from subtract_

In files with multiple items and `leaveright'>0, the `leaveright' right-most
 items are actually only summed in mean or weighted mean mode, replicating
 the behavior of the 
\series bold
average
\series default
 method.
 This is useful to combine averages containing the accumulated sums and
 sums of squares (for computing variance and t tests) as second and third
 item.
 In such averages, `leaveright' is automatically set to 2.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

With the option 
\series bold
-t
\series default
 in subtraction mode, the sum and sum of squares are used to calculate t
 comparisons and two-tailed p values for the difference of the means of
 independent samples.
 This assumes that the second and third items of both files contain the
 sum and the sum of squares of the samples, respectively, and that a nrofaverage
s property is specified in both files, as provided by 
\series bold
average -t -u
\series default
.
 Alternatively, the nrofaverages may be given on a point-by-point basis
 in a fourth item as output by the 
\series bold
average -M -t -u
\series default
 method.
 Note that the correct number of averages to use for a t test between groups
 is the actual number of values averaged to obtain the given mean and variance
 measures, not the sum of the weights (number of included epochs) as both
 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 value.
 When computing t tests with 3-item data, the output nrofaverages is set
 to n1+n2-1 allowing correct results in subsequent degrees of freedom calculatio
ns (in tests assuming equal variance).

With the option 
\series bold
-u
\series default
 in addition to 
\series bold

 The output nrofaverages setting explained above has the effect of enabling

\family default
 to compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

 This means that the output values contain variance and df information for
 the difference in a form that can be used for further pooling or comparison.

 This method performs a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channels
\begin_inset Formula $\times$

points matrix, yielding a number of items corresponding to different component
 waveforms; within each item, the waveforms of all channels are equal, only
 the amplitude is different.
 The sum across all items is equal to the original data set if all components
 are used.
 This view on the SVD result is somewhat `exploded', because a single representa
tion of the waveform together with an amplitude for each channel would suffice,
 but useful, because the result has the same form as the input.
 As usual with SVDs, the components are sorted by the magnitude of the singular
 value and the waveforms as well as the topographies of different components
 are orthogonal.

\end_inset

 The first use of this transform method is to trim all channels to a specified
 length.
 This can be useful in cases where the get-epoch method does not provide
 a way to influence the epoch length (like 
\series bold
readasc
\series default
 or 
\series bold
read_kn
\series default
) or where the epoch length might even vary (like in epochs read by 
\series bold
read_kn
\series default
).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Inclusion of data points starts at point offset (zeros are prepended if
 offset is negative) and proceeds through the specified length, appending
 zeros if less than length points are available in the source data starting
 at offset.
 This copying process is done for all ranges specified, appending all data
 in the output.
 This means that arbitrary sections of all channels (and the x data vector,
 if available) can be cut out and concatenated in any order.
 Ranges can also be specified by the x axis values of the first and last
 points to include (option -x; obviously, no extension with zeros will happen
 since boundaries are always within the data length), or, as a special extension
, defined very dynamically by the times during which values of a given channel
 fall into given ranges.
 Epoch triggers are correctly transferred if available.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Note that when 
\series bold
trim
\series default
 is used to select (concatenate) multiple sections of the current epoch,
 the absence of explicit x axis data has the consequence of a contiguous
 time axis being constructed later (eg by posplot).
 If the intention is to retain the original x values for each selected point,
 x axis data should be created explicitly before 
\series bold
trim
\series default
 (set xdata 1).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

By giving one of the collapse options, each of the specified ranges is reduced
 to a single output data point using the corresponding function.
 Thus, the output will have as many data points as ranges were specified.
 Corresponding ranges in the x data vector, if available, are always averaged.
 The nominal sampling frequency (sfreq) is not adjusted, because no general
 rule for such an adjustment exists.
 If a proper resampling with block averaging is intended, the 
\series bold
sliding_average
\series default
 method should be used.
 
\series bold
trim
\series default
 should instead be used if exact control of the average points or varying
 range sizes and spacings across the epoch are needed.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A `length' of 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 is replaced by the length of the rest of each incoming epoch starting at
 offset, which makes it possible to collapse all data points without specifying
 the epoch length explicitly in the script.

 and calculates offset and length of the range so that both points are included.
 Note that the x axis search just looks for the value in the stored x axis
 vector (which is created if not already present), thus it makes no sense
 to use unit specifiers like `s' or `Hz' in this case.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Because it is sometimes not desired to include both end points, it is possible
 to enter a point offset to the position closest to the given value in the
 form xvalue+offset or xvalue-offset.
 For example, 
\series bold
trim -s -x 0 5 5+1 10
\series default
 sums up all points from the one closest to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$

\begin_inset Formula $x=5$
\end_inset

 across these consecutive ranges (one value per such range, not per range

threshold (option -E).
 The output by default represents a valid avg_q trigger file: The point
 number at which the threshold was crossed, counted across all points seen

 The second column contains a trigger code that is either 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 if the slope at the crossing was positive or 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 if it was negative.
 – This default behavior is most useful for continuous files read with the

 position of the crossing relative to the start of the continuous file.

 preserves state between epochs by default (i.e., the last point(s) of the

\begin_inset Newline newline

\series bold
write_crossings
\series default
 writes extended information into the output file as `comment' lines beginning
 with a hash character (`#'): The number of points per epoch, as well as
 the sampling frequency and the threshold value, are output at the top of
 the file so that it is possible to calculate the epoch number from the
 output if necessary (see also option -x below).
 Also, the epoch number is output explicitly if option -x is given, and
 within each epoch the name of the current channel precedes the crossings
 data for that channel.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Using option -E, the point numbers and values at the local extrema in the
 given channel are output with trigger code 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 for maxima and 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 for minima, and a third column contains the value measured in the extremum.
 In this case, the threshold value serves to reduce the number of applicable
 points by the constraint that only 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{maxima}\geq\mathrm{threshold}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{minima}\leq\mathrm{threshold}$

 are output.
 Note that by making this value negative it is possible to allow local minima
 with positive values and maxima with negative values.
\begin_inset Newline newline

While the standard output format of 
\series bold
write_crossings
\series default
 is oriented at detection tasks in continuous files such as EOG candidate
 detection, option -e is for `epoched' data.
 In this epoch mode, the detector is restarted anew for each epoch and point
 numbers relative to the start of the epoch are reported.
 With option -x, x-axis values are reported by [x-label=value] pairs.
 Note that options -e and -x are independent but usually -x will make most
 sense together with -e.
 With either option, epochs are separated by comments noting epoch number,
 z_label and z_value (if available).
 This is for example useful to measure event-related potentials or to describe
 peaks in the latency–frequency plane.
\begin_inset Newline newline

As outfile argument, the name `triggers' is special besides the usual `stdin'
 and `stderr' values: It indicates that the points found are written into

 Epoch triggers can be shown by 
\series bold
posplot

 Collect method to assemble all incoming epochs to a single epoch 
\shape italic

\shape default
 by appending the time signals for each channel (default) or by adding channels
 or items.
 This is very similar to the 
\series bold
add_channels
\series default
 method, the difference being that points, channels or items are added successiv
ely from the iterated queue instead of once from a file.
 If points are appended, the number of channels and items in the incoming
 epochs must be equal in all incoming epochs, but not necessarily the number
 of sampling points; if channels are added, the number of points and items
 must be equal but the number of channels may vary, and for adding items,
 the number of items may vary.
 Since this method performs no data reduction at all, it is mainly useful
 in situations where all data is known to fit into memory but cannot be
 read as one epoch from the start.
 For example, if a spectral analysis of a single channel from a continuous
 file is performed and the frequencies distributed into separate channels
 using 
\series bold
swap_fc
\series default
, the single points resulting from each run through the iterated queue can
 be collected into one epoch using

 frequency.

Alternatively (option

 display them together via the

\begin_layout Description
-M: Match the channels of successive epochs by name.
 In this case, the averaged epochs may have different numbers of channels,
 such as when forming a grand average with deleted bad channels.
 Unless one of the sign test methods is specified, an additional output
 item is created containing the number of averages or sum of weights on
 a by-point basis.
 Note that this method will give unexpected results with epochs containing
 multiple channels with the same name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-N: forces the output nrofaverages property to be the number of averaged
 epochs; this useful if weights are used with -u, since the correct degrees
 of freedom for the t-test can be determined from the number of averaged
 files, not the sum of the weights.
 This way, a grand average of high quality (using weights) can be obtained
 simultaneously with the correct degrees of freedom of the t test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-W: Use the nrofaverages property of the incoming epochs to perform a weighted
 average.
 This is only useful if the epochs come from multiple averaged files (readasc
 or NeuroScan format) with different nrofaverages values.

 Warning: the comparison against averaged baseline produces spurious `significan

 This means that one comparison is computed for each baseline value.
 If the current value itself is in the baseline, then the test against itself
 is skipped.
 The averaged test result 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in[0\ldots1]$
\end_inset

 is added to the 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{+}$

 Collect method to calculate a histogram of the values received from each
 incoming epoch.
 The histogram boundaries are the same for all points and channels and must
 be specified explicitly.
 Different input points or frequencies are mapped onto different output
 items (mapping into a single output item can be requested using option
 -p), and the x axis will be the amplitude bin on output.
 The input may not contain multiple items per point.
 The histograms may be calculated separately for each channel (default)
 or for all channels combined (option -c), in which case only one channel
 descriptor named `h_collapsed' is output.
 The processed input x range can be restricted in order to avoid output
 with a large number of items.
 The amplitude values and unit will be properly noted on the output x axis
 and eventual latency values on the z axis, but since no values are associated
 with the item axis, no reference to the point or frequency values corresponding
 to output items is available in the output.

 Generic put-epoch method for writing headerless files with data stored
 in successive elements of one of various types.
 Since no header is written, all meta-information is lost.
 data_type can be uint8, int8, int16, int32, float32, float64 or string;
 cf.
 the 
\series bold
read_generic
\series default
 method.
 If the output file is to contain a header, then the header section must
 be prepared by some other program and the -a option can be used to append
 the data to it.
 The `string' data type output is a text tab-delimited floating-point format
 with data points (or channels, with the -P option) separated by newlines.
 It can of course be read by the corresponding data type option of 
\series bold
read_generic
\series default
 .
 If the string data output should be integer, 
\series bold
calc rint
\series default
 can be used before this method.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Multiple items per channel and sampling point are silently written as adjacent
 single values, which will make the output file appear to have a corresponding
 multiple of channels or, with the option -P, points.
 
\series bold
read_generic
\series default
 can, however, properly redistribute the values across a specified number
 of items.
 If only one item is to be written, the 
\series bold
extract_item
\series default
 method should be applied first.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The options -z and -C add columns to the output that usually have a high
 level of redundancy; however, there are many multidimensional visualization
 and statistics packages which accept the data in such an `exploded', non-hierar
chical view.

 Put-epoch method to write epochs to any of the sound formats supported

 uses the SOX library verbatim, just writing data to it and redirecting
 fatal errors, warnings and reports (tracelevel 2) to its own error and
 trace handling system.
 The output file type is determined from the file extension.
 For example, `a.wav' will write a Windows RIFF file, `a.voc' a Creative Labs
 VOC file, `a.alsa' and `a.pulseaudio' will write directly to the corresponding
 output devices.
 Writing to output devices will not actually create Outfile.
 Of course, not all output formats (and especially not all sound processing
 software) will be able to handle more than 2 or 4 channels, so that it
 will often be advisable to use the

 epoched (.EEG), continuous (.CNT, option -c) or `averaged' (.AVG, option -A)
 file.
 For the .EEG and .CNT formats, data is coded as short integers, and the conversio
 n factor conv_factor is used to project the data to a 16 bit-codeable range.
 This factor is stored with the data as a 32-bit floating-point value (inversely
 coded into the channel property `sensitivity', which is actually an amplitude-p
 er-bit measure) and taken into account on reads, so that its application
 does not result in an actual data scaling.
 If available, the trigger code for the epoch is written into the epoched
 file in a way compatible with 
\series bold
read_synamps
\series default
 , so that stimulus and response codes are retained when epochs were read
 from a NeuroScan file.
 The continuous type created with the -c option is `100/330 kHz' (cf.
 
\series bold
read_synamps
\series default
); the event table will usually contain only the start/stop marker at the
 end, but if trigger tables were present in the incoming epochs (as with
 
\series bold
read_synamps
\series default
 -T), these triggers will be written to the event table as well.
 This makes it easy to manipulate, resample or append .CNT files while properly
 maintaining the events.
 The .AVG format is provided mainly because various source modeling programs
 can read it; data is stored as 32-Bit floating point values and the conv_factor
 is ignored.
 Since it only supports a single epoch, trying to write a second epoch or
 trying to append epochs to an existing file is an error with this format.

\end_inset

 Put-epoch method to write epochs to a binary `vitaport' file.
 As explained for 
\series bold
read_vitaport
\series default
, this format stores the channels separately, which is why appending to
 such a file is not feasible.
 For the same reason, 
\series bold
write_vitaport
\series default
 collects the data in separate temporary files, one per channel; the actual
 target file is only built after all epochs have been processed in this
 manner.
 This two-stage process also allows 
\series bold
write_vitaport
\series default
 to automatically choose scale factors for storing the channel data as short
 integers.
 Any channel named `MARKER' is stored with conversion factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0$
\end_inset

 in any case, because markers are read as raw integers.
 Currently, only the `reconfigured Vitaport II format' is written, all channels
 are coded with 16 bits and with the same sampling frequency.
 One big problem with this format is that the sampling frequency is not
 simply stored as a floating-point value, but rather as a divisor of a base
 frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $76800$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Hz.
 For example, it is not possible to precisely code a sampling rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $500$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Hz.
 The nearest value chosen when such a file is written is 
\begin_inset Formula $498.701$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Hz, which will render trigger times incorrect that are in time units, such
 as the VITAGRAPH markers that are in milliseconds.
 It thus can be necessary to resample a file (e.g.
 using the 
\series bold
sliding_average
\series default
 method) to a rate that can be exactly represented before writing Vitaport
 data.
 As with 
\series bold
write_synamps
\series default
, any triggers passed with incoming epochs are written to the event table
 at the end of the file.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Data organization:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The posplot module can display data with up to 5 dimensions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A number of data sets (`z axis')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A number of channels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiple y values (items) for each x in each of the above (e.g.
 complex data)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there are quite elaborate precautions to display data sets with
 different numbers of data points or channels in a useful manner.
 Different numbers of data points are handled by always plotting the data
 against the corresponding x axis values, therefore allowing data with different
 sampling rates but equal x data ranges to be superimposed just as data
 spanning different x ranges.
 Posplot version 2.98 (March 2001) introduced the use of a `channel map',
 a list of channel names and positions initialized from all available data
 sets, which guarantees that channels with the same name and position always
 appear at the same plotting position irrespective of the order they have
 in the different data sets (of special importance for overlaying data sets
 in which channels have been removed because of artifacts).
 The 
\emph on
order
\emph default
 of channels defined by this list is mostly important for the vertical display
 mode.
 Note that some functions using or modifying channel positions, such as
 dipole fitting, triangulation and gridding, cannot use posplot's channel
 map but work on the channels as defined by the first or first selected
 data set.
 The interactive `sensor position manipulation', however, does work on the
 channel map and modifies the position of the current channel in all data
 sets synchronously.
 Channels with identical names but different positions are displayed with
 a number in braces appended to their name, without modifying their actual
 names in the data set.
 When channels are selected in posplot by entering their name, the unique
 name shown by posplot should be used.
 If multiple channels with the same name and position occur within one data
 set, the value 
\begin_inset Formula $0.123$
\end_inset

 is added to the x position of the second channel in order to maintain a
 unique mapping between (name, position) in each data set and in the channel
 map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Selection of data sets:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To show/unshow a data set, left click into the data set bar at the right.
 By default, no data set is selected and all data sets will appear in white.
 Shown (selected) data sets appear in green.
 Note that data traces will only appear after plotting is toggled on by
 using the `p' key (see below in the `commands' section).

their display status will not be changed by the up/down movement or 'toggle

 Fixed selected data sets appear in yellow, fixed deselected data sets in
 red.
 Fixing data sets was designed for situations where one specific data set
 should always remain shown for comparison, while the other data sets are

 Channels can also be toggled by name or number by entering the name, or
 the number with a hash `#' prepended, as an argument with `=' (see below)
 before pressing <backspace>.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To toggle displaying a single channel, point to it with the mouse and press
 the <enter> key or the right mouse button.
 As with <backspace>, a channel name or number to make the only one displayed

Changing the channel layout:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
_ (underscore): Cycle through three `position modes': position layout of
 channel plots, `vertical mode' (i.e.
 channels stacked vertically) and `overlay mode' (i.e.
 all channels are plotted on top of each other).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In vertical mode, the keys J and K can be used to move the selected channel
 down or up in the channel map and therefore down and up on the screen.
 The selected channel is moved directly before or after the first or last
 shown channel.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A fourth, 3-D `sensor position manipulation' mode can be entered by typing
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

change
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as an argument with the `=' command (see below) before the underscore.
 While all other keys continue to work as usual, the uppercase rotation
 keys H, J, K and L are redefined to move the currently selected channel
 on the screen to the left, down, up and right, respectively.
 This is done by adjusting the actual 3-D sensor positions in the plane
 perpendicular to the current line of sight.
 Note that while all other rotations etc.
 in posplot only change the view on the data, this changes the actual sensor
 position values in the current data set as they are seen by subsequent
 methods.
 The normal position mode is entered by typing underscore again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
G Arrange the channels on a grid.
 This overwrites the current positions.
 Gridding actually works only on the first or first selected data set; this
 data set is then used to initialize the channel map (cf.
 the channel map initialization done by `C').
 Therefore, channels not available in this data set will retain their positions.
 If a `=' argument is available, it will be used as the number of colums
 of the channel grid to create.

 the range only expands as necessary but doesn't shrink.
 If a `=' argument is available, it must have the form lower_bound upper_bound
 and the scale is fixed to these values.
 From incremental scale mode, pressing `v' switches to fixed mode with the
 current values; from fixed mode, pressing `v' reactivates autoscaling.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

auto-subsampling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was introduced and enabled by default based upon the number of displayed
 points per available display points in the x dimension.
 Auto subsampling is switched off once a sampling step is specified by hand.
 '@' without argument toggles between fixed sampling step and auto subsampling;
 the fixed step width used is 1.
 Since August 2007, a line is drawn between the minimum and maximum data
 value in the skipped points; this effectively avoids aliasing problems
 (seeing lower frequencies than actually present in the data) and shows
 spikes where they are present.

 If the vertical scale is fixed, the global minimum and maximum values are
 taken instead; therefore, the grey scale will remain fixed as well, which
 is desirable for viewing time sequences as a `movie'.
\end_layout

 The format of this file has changed in posplot version 2.33 (May 1997).
 It used to be a two-column list of numbers, `device' and `value', directly

 This works correspondingly with `

 Note that use of mouse events, although supported, is not recommended for
 recording, because the screen layout may be different at the time of playback;

 Its basic function is to read a number of asc files (all with the same

 Options allow the additional computation of the sum and sum of squares

 method needs much less options while still providing more flexibility.
 However, each file processed by

 can have multiple epochs, e.g.
 for the different latencies or `shifts' resulting from spectral analysis,
 and averages the corresponding epochs for all input files.

\begin_layout Description
-B: writes output in binary format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-s: outputs the square root of the averaged squares.
 This is useful if the files contain spectral data stored as the square
 root of the spectral power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-t: performs a t-test

 against average baseline for each value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-T: does the same with the log values (although the original values are
 used for the average)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-d: performs a t-test of each value against 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 This is useful if the values themselves are already differences or in conjuncti
on with 
\series bold
-u
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-D: does the same with the log values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-u: outputs the accumulated parameters for the t test (sum and sum of squares)
 instead of t and p.
 This option is only useful in conjunction with one of the t-test options.
 The parameters can subsequently be used for a paired t-test, for example
 with the 
\series bold
subtract -t
\series default
 method of 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-N: forces the output nrofaverages property to be the number of files; this
 useful if weights are used with -u, since the correct degrees of freedom
 for the t-test can be determined from the number of averaged files, not
 the sum of the weights.
 This way, a grand average of high quality (using weights) can be obtained
 simultaneously with the correct degrees of freedom of the t test.

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

weight_filename: Instead of simple averaging with equal weight, file names
 to process and associated weights are read from the given weight file,
 one per line.
 No additional asc files may be specified on the command line.
 The operation performed is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sum_{i}\,x_{i}w_{i}\right)/\left(\sum_{i}\,w_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 runs across files, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the value from and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 the weight for file 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-W: uses the nrofaverages property of the specified files as weights.
 nrofaverages is set correctly by the 
\series bold
average
\series default
 method of 
\series bold
avg_q
\series default
 and also by 
\series bold
ascaverage
\series default
 itself (namely, to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\textstyle \sum_{i}\,w_{i}}$
\end_inset

 if 
\series bold
-w
\series default
 or 
\series bold
-W
\series default
 are used), so that averaging files with 
\series bold
ascaverage -W
\series default
 is usually equivalent to averaging with equal weight all data that was
 averaged for the input files.

 latencies) of an asc file, in the ASCII text form read by various plotting
 programs: The frequency in column 1, the latency in column 2, and the data
 items in the following columns.
 All frequencies for the one latency are output on successive lines, and
 a blank line separates each latency block from the next.
