 '''Artifact_Segmentation Script class to detect artifacts in a section of a continuous file
    and work on the artifact-free segments between them.
    Three types of artifacts are detected: Peaks exceeding ArtifactDetectionThreshold,
    Jumps (discontinuities) exceeding JumpDetectionThreshold and blocking (zero difference
    between adjacent points) exceeding a duration of min_blocking_points.
    The threshold amplitudes are relative to the median across all points - each channel is normalized
    by its median before the operation because the typical amplitude of each channel usually varies
    with its distance from the reference. By this procedure the operation is scale free.
    There are two causes of blocking - during a recording, it indicates amplifier saturation;
    in some environments (eg sleep), disconnecting the amplifiers results in zero lines written.
    For this reason, blocking marks possibly extended regions, while the other two artifact types
    are detected as single points.'''
